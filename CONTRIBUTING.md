## Contribution guidelines

Every author must create a new folder for a new article.

The repository structure must be as follows:
* 1 folder for 1 article
* a file named `article.md` for the actual content
* any additional materials (such as images) must be placed in the same folder.

The names of folders and files should be descriptive and reflect the article subject.

When starting the article, an author has to create a PR to the `blog-posts` repository, all changes must be added as new PRs, reviewed and approved by the [marketing team](https://github.com/orgs/serokell/teams/marketing).
